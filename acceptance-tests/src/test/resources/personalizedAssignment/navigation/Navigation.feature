  Scenario Outline: Entering a url that is ahead of the origin page
    Given that I am on the <origin> page
    When I enter the url for the <target> page
    Then I am redirected to the <expected> page
    And the <expected> form is <filled> with the values I previously entered
    And the payment, retain and both vehicle-and-keeper cookies are <wiped>
  Examples:
    | origin           | target    | expected         | filled   | wiped       |
    | "vehicle-lookup" | "confirm" | "vehicle-lookup" | "filled" | "not wiped" |
#    | "vehicle-lookup" | "payment" | "vehicle-lookup" | "filled" | "not wiped" |
#    | "vehicle-lookup" | "success" | "vehicle-lookup" | "filled" | "not wiped" |
#    | "confirm"        | "payment" | "confirm"        | "filled" | "not wiped" |
#    | "confirm"        | "success" | "confirm"        | "filled" | "not wiped" |
#    | "payment (keeper acting)"        | "success" | "payment"        | "-"      | "not wiped" |
#    | "payment (keeper acting)"        | "success" | "payment"        | "-"      | "not wiped" |


  Scenario Outline: Pressing the browser's back button
    Given that I am on the <origin> page

    And the payment, retain and both vehicle-and-keeper cookies are <wiped>
