  Scenario Outline: Entering a url that is before the origin page (keeper acting)
    Given that I am on the <origin> page
    When I enter the url for the <target> page
    Then I am redirected to the <expected> page
    And the <expected> form is <filled> with the values I previously entered
    And the payment, retain and both vehicle-and-keeper cookies are <wiped>
